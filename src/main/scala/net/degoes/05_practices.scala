/*
 * INTRODUCTION
 *
 * In Functional Design, composable operators allow building infinitely many
 * solutions from a few operators and domain constructors.
 *
 * Operators and constructors are either primitive, meaning they cannot be
 * expressed in terms of others, or they are derived, meaning they can be
 * expressed in terms of other operators or constructors.
 *
 * The choice of primitives determine how powerful and expressive a domain
 * model is. Some choices lead to weaker models, and others, to more powerful
 * models. Power is not always a good thing: constraining the power of a model
 * allows more efficient and more feature-full execution.
 *
 * Derived operators and constructors bridge the gap from the domain, to common
 * problems that a user of the domain has to solve, improving productivity.
 *
 * In many domains, there exist many potential choices for the set of primitive
 * operators and constructors. But not all choices are equally good.
 *
 * The best primitives are:
 *
 * * Composable, to permit a lot of power in a small, reasonable package
 * * Expressive, to solve the full range of problems in the domain
 * * Orthogonal, such that no primitive provides the capabilities of any other
 *
 * Orthogonality also implies minimalism, which means the primitives are the
 * smallest set of orthogonal primitives that exist.
